...


This project presents a practical demonstration of Lean methodology using a simple real-life process — making coffee. The presentation explains Lean principles, the 7 types of waste, and how to identify inefficiencies in any workflow. A complete “before vs after” comparison visually showcases how eliminating waste, reducing motion, and optimizing process flow can drastically improve efficiency.



## ✅ 📌 Project Summary

The goal of the project is to illustrate how Lean thinking can streamline operations, reduce time, eliminate redundancy, and drive continuous improvement in both personal workflows and business environments.
This project highlights core Lean concepts through a clear process-mapping example. It breaks down each step of a workflow, identifies waste (waiting, motion, overproduction, etc.), and proposes actionable improvement strategies. The transformed (“after Lean”) workflow results in:

40% reduction in process time

60% reduction in unnecessary motion

50% reduction in waste

Using a relatable example (coffee preparation), the project makes Lean methodology easy to understand and highly applicable to daily operations, manufacturing, service environments, and business processes.
